# domain name cleaner
 scripts to take domain name input and return clean domains

 first version very simply removes domain prefixes (http, www) etc. 

 the end goal is just to return a clean standard domain ("apple.com" NOT "apple.com/home/store")

 the next version/step is to delete everything after .com OR .net, etc. I will need to do regex and positive lookahead of the symbol " / " for that.
